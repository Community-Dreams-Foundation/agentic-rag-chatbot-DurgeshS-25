This is a test document for the CDF hackathon.
The system should read this file and split it into overlapping chunks.
We are currently testing ingestion and chunking.

The purpose of this document is to verify that:
1. Files are discovered recursively.
2. Text is extracted correctly.
3. Chunks are generated with metadata.
4. Each chunk has a unique chunk_id.
5. The system works deterministically.

Repeat this paragraph multiple times to ensure multiple chunks are created.
