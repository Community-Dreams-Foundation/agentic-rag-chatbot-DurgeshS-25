    are designated at the time of hire and require manager and HR approval for

SECTION 8: STRATEGIC GOALS (2025–2027)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ARR Expansion: Reach $300M ARR by end of FY2027 through new logo growth
   and expansion revenue in existing accounts.

2. Platform Unification: Consolidate SupplyView, ProcureIQ, and RiskRadar
   under a single unified data model by Q2 2026.

3. International Growth: Increase European revenue contribution from 21% to
   30% by launching a dedicated EMEA go-to-market motion in H1 2025.

4. FedRAMP Certification: Complete FedRAMP authorization to unlock US federal
   government procurement opportunities in 2025.

   procurement recommendations — into production by Q4 2025.

6. Talent: Grow headcount from 1,240 to 1,600 by end of 2025, with focus on
   engineering (40% of new hires) and sales (30% of new hires).


SECTION 9: KNOWN LIMITATIONS AND RISKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Platform scalability above 10,000 concurrent API connections is untested;
  engineering is addressing this in the Q2 2025 infrastructure sprint.

- RiskRadar's geopolitical scoring relies on third-party news aggregators;
  latency in aggregator feeds can cause up to 4-hour delays in risk alerts.

- NexaBridge currently has no native mobile application; customers rely on
  browser-based access or third-party MDM integrations.

- Competitive pressure from SAP Ariba and Oracle Fusion is intensifying in
  the enterprise segment; NexaBridge's win rate has declined from 38% to 31%
  in head-to-head deals over the past 12 months.

- The FedRAMP authorization process has experienced two delays and may slip
  beyond the Q3 2025 target.
